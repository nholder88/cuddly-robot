This backlog covers all components in `Design/wiki-update-architecture.md` and is ordered as a dependency-safe DAG.

Implementation-ready Stage 3 refinement: `Design/wiki-update-pbi.md`.

## Task WU-01: Define Shared Wiki Update Policy Contract

**Priority**: P0-Critical
**Estimated Complexity**: Small
**Dependencies**: None
**Component**: Repository Host Policy Contract

### Description
Create a shared YAML policy contract for wiki update scope, trigger, failure handling, and output defaults.

### Requirements
- [ ] Create `templates/shared/wiki-update-contract.yaml`.
- [ ] Encode defaults: `scope` (`github.com` + GHES allowlist), `trigger: stage7_pass`, `failureMode: non_blocking_warning_audit`, `outputMode: pr`, `humanApproval: true`.
- [ ] Add classification include/exclude taxonomy for user-facing content.

### Technical Specification
- File to create: `templates/shared/wiki-update-contract.yaml`.
- Required top-level keys: `version`, `name`, `policy`, `classification`.
- `policy.scope` must include `githubDotCom` boolean and `ghesAllowlist` array.
- Classification schema must separate `include` and `exclude` criteria.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Contract file exists and is valid YAML.
- [ ] All approved defaults are represented exactly.
- [ ] Classification rules explicitly include functional changes/how-to and exclude technical internals.

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests covering: YAML parse and required key presence.
- [ ] Integration tests covering: validator can load and reference contract path.
- [ ] Edge case tests: empty/missing `ghesAllowlist` remains valid while non-GitHub hosts are excluded.
- [ ] All tests pass with no regressions.

### Completion Checklist
- [ ] Implementation complete per requirements
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] All testing requirements satisfied and tests passing
- [ ] Code review agent has reviewed and approved
- [ ] No linting errors or warnings
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable
- [ ] Confirmed working end-to-end

## Task WU-02: Add Stage 7 Post-Task Hook in Orchestrator

**Priority**: P0-Critical
**Estimated Complexity**: Medium
**Dependencies**: WU-01
**Component**: Orchestrator Post-Task Trigger

### Description
Add orchestrator logic to invoke wiki update flow after Stage 7 PASS only, with policy contract gating.

### Requirements
- [ ] Define post-Stage-7 invocation path for wiki update flow.
- [ ] Ensure trigger is constrained to Stage 7 PASS.
- [ ] Ensure policy contract is loaded before any wiki action.

### Technical Specification
- Modify orchestration definitions and stage flow references:
  - `agents/orchestrator.agent.md`
  - Pipeline stage docs under `agent-progress/` where required.
- Add explicit branch: if Stage 7 PASS then evaluate wiki flow, else skip.
- Include stage label and audit hook references for non-blocking failure path.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Stage 7 PASS is the only trigger path for wiki flow.
- [ ] No wiki flow runs for failed/incomplete Stage 7 outcomes.
- [ ] Orchestrator documentation clearly shows post-task hook and skip behavior.

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests covering: trigger condition evaluation logic (pass/fail).
- [ ] Integration tests covering: end-to-end simulated pipeline with Stage 7 PASS invokes wiki flow once.
- [ ] Edge case tests: reruns/retries do not duplicate wiki flow without explicit rerun intent.
- [ ] All tests pass with no regressions.

### Completion Checklist
- [ ] Implementation complete per requirements
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] All testing requirements satisfied and tests passing
- [ ] Code review agent has reviewed and approved
- [ ] No linting errors or warnings
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable
- [ ] Confirmed working end-to-end

## Task WU-03: Implement GitHub Host Scope and GHES Allowlist Enforcement

**Priority**: P0-Critical
**Estimated Complexity**: Medium
**Dependencies**: WU-01, WU-02
**Component**: Repository Host Policy Contract

### Description
Enforce repository host checks so wiki updates run only on `github.com` and allowlisted GHES hosts.

### Requirements
- [ ] Detect repository host from pipeline/repo metadata.
- [ ] Normalize hostnames before matching.
- [ ] Enforce allowlist rules for GHES.
- [ ] Skip and audit when scope check fails.

### Technical Specification
- Add policy evaluation logic in orchestrator/runtime integration points.
- Reference `templates/shared/wiki-update-contract.yaml` as source of truth.
- Create deterministic host matching behavior:
  - `github.com` always allowed when `githubDotCom: true`.
  - GHES host must match `ghesAllowlist`.
  - All other hosts are skipped.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] `github.com` repositories proceed to classification.
- [ ] Allowlisted GHES repositories proceed to classification.
- [ ] Non-allowlisted/non-GitHub hosts skip with warning/audit event.

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests covering: host normalization and allowlist match rules.
- [ ] Integration tests covering: sample `github.com`, allowlisted GHES, and unsupported host cases.
- [ ] Edge case tests: case-insensitive hostnames and trailing dot/port variants.
- [ ] All tests pass with no regressions.

### Completion Checklist
- [ ] Implementation complete per requirements
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] All testing requirements satisfied and tests passing
- [ ] Code review agent has reviewed and approved
- [ ] No linting errors or warnings
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable

**Priority**: P1-High
**Estimated Complexity**: Medium
**Dependencies**: WU-01, WU-02
**Component**: Wiki Candidate Classifier

### Description
Design and codify deterministic rules that decide whether completed work is worth end-user wiki documentation.

### Requirements
- [ ] Include functional changes and how-to guidance as positive criteria.
- [ ] Exclude purely technical internals and refactor-only noise.
- [ ] Emit machine-readable reason codes for every decision.

### Technical Specification
- Update wiki-related agent/design docs and contract annotations.
- Define rubric outputs:
  - `eligible: boolean`
  - `reasonCode: string`
  - `summaryHints: string[]`
- Add explicit decision table examples for common cases.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Rubric includes clear include/exclude logic.
- [ ] Every classification decision returns a reason code.
- [ ] Ambiguous cases have deterministic fallback behavior.

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests covering: classification decision table for happy path and exclusion path.
- [ ] Integration tests covering: classifier receives Stage 7 task context and returns structured output.
- [ ] Edge case tests: mixed changes (functional plus internal) still produce stable decisions.
- [ ] All tests pass with no regressions.

### Completion Checklist
- [ ] Implementation complete per requirements
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] All testing requirements satisfied and tests passing
- [ ] Code review agent has reviewed and approved
