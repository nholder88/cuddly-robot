# Wiki Update PBIs (Implementation-Ready, Stage 3)

## 1. Summary
This feature adds a post-task wiki update flow that runs after Stage 7 PASS, applies only to `github.com` and allowlisted GHES hosts, and emits PR-mode user-facing documentation artifacts that require human approval. The goal is consistent scaffold and parity support across all template stacks while reducing noisy or internal-only wiki updates through deterministic classification and explicit audit behavior.

## 2. Assumptions Log
| # | Assumption | Status | Notes |
|---|-----------|--------|-------|
| A1 | Trigger point is Stage 7 PASS only. | Confirmed | Required by context package and `Design/wiki-update-architecture.md`. |
| A2 | Default failure behavior is warning plus audit, with no pipeline failure. | Confirmed | Required by context package and WU-06 scope. |
| A3 | Default output mode is `pr` and default approval is human-gated. | Confirmed | Required by context package and architecture defaults. |
| A4 | Wiki content scope is end-user functional changes plus how-to guidance. | Confirmed | Required by context package and architecture classification include list. |
| A5 | Low-level technical internals are excluded from generated wiki content. | Confirmed | Required by context package and architecture classification exclude list. |
| A6 | GHES allowlist source is `templates/shared/wiki-update-contract.yaml`. | Needs Clarification | Architecture implies this source; runtime loading path is implementation-dependent. |
| A7 | PR-mode output destination is a deterministic artifact format consumed by orchestrator. | Needs Clarification | Exact artifact path and naming convention are not defined in current docs. |
| A8 | Duplicate Stage 7 retry handling uses idempotent wiki-flow execution keyed by task context. | Needs Clarification | Backlog requires no duplicate generation on retries; key strategy is not yet specified. |

## 3. Open Questions
Functional:
1. What exact reason-code vocabulary is approved for classifier decisions, and which codes are mandatory for reporting?
2. For mixed-change tasks, does one valid end-user functional change always force `eligible: true` even when most diffs are internal?

Technical:
1. Which file and schema define the PR-mode artifact payload consumed by orchestrator after wiki generation?
2. What idempotency key fields define a unique wiki-flow run for Stage 7 reruns: `taskId`, `commitSha`, `pipelineRunId`, or another combination?
3. Which location stores audit events in this repo context: stage progress markdown only, structured JSON artifact, or both?

Scope:
1. Is WU-09 limited to maintainer documentation in `README.md` and `templates/README.md`, or does it include a dedicated runbook file under `Documentation/`?
2. Does GHES allowlist governance include approval workflow requirements, or only file-level change control guidance?

## 4. Functional Acceptance Criteria

### PBI-WU-01: Shared Wiki Update Policy Contract
AC-1: Contract creation with approved defaults (happy path)
  Given repository templates under `templates/shared/`
  When `templates/shared/wiki-update-contract.yaml` is added
  Then the file parses as valid YAML
  And it contains `version`, `name`, `policy`, and `classification`
  And `policy` defaults are exactly `scope.githubDotCom: true`, `scope.ghesAllowlist: []`, `trigger: stage7_pass`, `failureMode: non_blocking_warning_audit`, `outputMode: pr`, `humanApproval: true`.

AC-2: Invalid or missing required keys (error path)
  Given the contract file omits any required top-level or policy key
  When parity validation runs
  Then validation fails
  And the error message identifies the missing key and file path.

AC-3: Empty GHES allowlist with github.com enabled (edge case)
  Given `scope.ghesAllowlist` is empty and `scope.githubDotCom` is true
  When host policy evaluation runs for `github.com`
  Then `github.com` remains in scope
  And non-GitHub hosts remain out of scope.

### PBI-WU-02: Stage 7 Post-Task Orchestrator Hook
AC-1: Stage 7 PASS trigger only (happy path)
  Given a pipeline run reaches Stage 7 with result PASS
  When orchestrator evaluates post-task actions
  Then wiki flow executes once
  And the invocation includes policy contract context.

AC-2: Non-PASS stage outcome skip behavior (error path)
  Given Stage 7 result is FAIL or INCOMPLETE
  When orchestrator evaluates post-task actions
  Then wiki flow is skipped
  And skip reason is recorded in stage audit output.

AC-3: Stage 7 retry without explicit wiki rerun intent (edge case)
  Given Stage 7 is retried for the same task context
  When orchestrator post-task evaluation executes
  Then duplicate wiki flow does not execute
  And audit output records idempotent skip metadata.

### PBI-WU-03: GitHub Host Scope and GHES Allowlist Enforcement
AC-1: In-scope host routing (happy path)
  Given repository metadata host is `github.com` or an allowlisted GHES hostname
  When host policy evaluation executes
  Then the task proceeds to classifier evaluation
  And host normalization is applied before matching.

AC-2: Out-of-scope host handling (error path)
  Given repository metadata host is not `github.com` and not allowlisted GHES
  When host policy evaluation executes
  Then wiki flow is skipped
  And a non-blocking warning plus audit record is emitted.

AC-3: Hostname normalization variants (edge case)
  Given host metadata includes case differences, trailing dots, or explicit port values
  When host policy evaluation executes
  Then normalized host comparison remains deterministic
  And allowlist matching outcome is stable.

### PBI-WU-04: Candidate Classification Rubric
AC-1: User-facing eligible classification (happy path)
  Given a completed task includes end-user functional change and actionable how-to implications
  When classifier evaluates the task package
  Then classifier returns `eligible: true`
  And output includes `reasonCode` and `summaryHints`.

AC-2: Internal-only change exclusion (error path)
  Given a completed task contains only internal refactor or low-level technical details
  When classifier evaluates the task package
  Then classifier returns `eligible: false`
  And reason code maps to exclusion taxonomy.

AC-3: Mixed-change deterministic fallback (edge case)
  Given a task includes both functional and internal changes
  When classifier evaluates the task package
  Then classifier returns deterministic eligibility based on rubric precedence
  And the same input set yields the same result across runs.

### PBI-WU-05: Wiki Update Agent Spec and Output Contract
AC-1: Required user-facing sections in generated artifact (happy path)
  Given classifier marks a task as eligible
  When wiki update agent generates output
  Then output includes `What changed for users`, `How to use`, and `Out of scope/internal details`
  And output mode metadata is `pr`
  And approval metadata indicates human approval required.

AC-2: Generation failure behavior (error path)
  Given classifier marks a task as eligible and content generation fails
  When wiki update generation completes with error
  Then wiki path reports non-blocking warning and audit record
  And pipeline stage outcome remains unchanged.

AC-3: Non-eligible candidate bypass (edge case)
  Given classifier marks a task as not eligible
  When wiki flow executes
  Then content generation is bypassed
  And bypass reason is recorded in audit output.

### PBI-WU-06: Non-Blocking Failure and Audit Trail
AC-1: Failure does not block pipeline (happy path for resilience)
  Given any wiki sub-step returns an error
  When failure policy executes
  Then pipeline completion status remains based on core stage outcomes only
  And warning output is emitted.

AC-2: Missing audit payload field handling (error path)
  Given failure handling attempts to emit audit payload with missing required field
  When audit emission executes
  Then payload construction fails closed for that event schema
  And fallback warning includes minimal context `taskId`, `stage`, and error summary.

AC-3: Repeated transient failures across retries (edge case)
  Given multiple retry attempts each hit a transient wiki error
  When failure policy executes each attempt
  Then each attempt emits an audit record
  And no attempt flips pipeline to failed due to wiki path alone.

### PBI-WU-07: Stack Template Scaffold Support Fields
AC-1: Stack-wide wiki_update section parity (happy path)
  Given all stack `template-spec.yaml` files in `templates/frontend-*` and `templates/backend-*`
  When wiki scaffold fields are added
  Then each stack contains `wiki_update.enabled`, `wiki_update.contract_ref`, `wiki_update.output_mode_default`, and `wiki_update.human_approval_default`
  And each stack uses identical default values and contract path.

AC-2: Single stack omission (error path)
  Given one stack omits any required `wiki_update` key
  When parity validation runs
  Then validation fails
  And output identifies the exact stack spec path and missing key.

AC-3: Divergent defaults in one stack (edge case)
  Given one stack has different output mode or approval default
  When parity validation runs
  Then validation fails
  And output identifies mismatch against shared contract defaults.

### PBI-WU-08: Parity Validator Coverage for Wiki Contract
AC-1: Compliant wiki fields pass parity validation (happy path)
  Given shared wiki contract and all stack specs are compliant
  When `npm run templates:test-parity` and `npm run templates:validate-parity` run
  Then both commands pass
  And existing non-wiki parity checks remain passing.

AC-2: Missing or malformed wiki contract file (error path)
  Given `templates/shared/wiki-update-contract.yaml` is missing or malformed
  When parity validation runs
  Then validation fails
  And output provides actionable remediation guidance.

AC-3: Partial stack updates and unknown stack keys (edge case)
  Given only subset stack updates exist or unknown stack keys appear in wiki checks
  When parity validation runs
  Then validation fails
  And output enumerates each non-compliant item.

### PBI-WU-09: Operator Workflow and Governance Documentation
AC-1: Deterministic operator workflow documentation (happy path)
  Given wiki update feature defaults are implemented
  When docs are updated
  Then `README.md` and `templates/README.md` describe trigger timing, host scope, output mode, approval flow, and failure behavior
  And instructions include parity validation commands.

AC-2: Broken doc references or commands (error path)
  Given documentation references non-existent files or scripts
  When doc verification runs
  Then validation fails
  And references are corrected before merge.

AC-3: Unsupported host troubleshooting path (edge case)
  Given maintainers troubleshoot non-GitHub repositories
  When they follow documented steps
  Then docs explain skip behavior and audit interpretation
  And docs include GHES allowlist governance path.

## 7. Implementation Steps
1. **Create shared policy contract (WU-01)** -- Add `templates/shared/wiki-update-contract.yaml` with approved defaults and classification include/exclude taxonomy. Acceptance: YAML parses and parity load path resolves.
2. **Add orchestrator post-task hook (WU-02)** -- Update `agents/orchestrator.agent.md` with Stage 7 PASS gate and explicit skip/audit paths for non-PASS. Acceptance: orchestrator docs show one PASS-only entry point.
3. **Implement host scope enforcement (WU-03)** -- Add host normalization and allowlist evaluation logic in orchestrator/wiki integration definitions referencing `templates/shared/wiki-update-contract.yaml`. Acceptance: host policy cases map deterministically to proceed or skip.
4. **Define classifier rubric outputs (WU-04)** -- Add deterministic decision table and reason-code outputs in wiki design and agent assets. Acceptance: rubric supports include/exclude and mixed-change precedence.
5. **Add wiki update agent and output contract (WU-05)** -- Create a wiki update agent file under `agents/` and document output contract fields for PR routing and approval metadata. Acceptance: required user-facing sections and metadata are present.
6. **Wire non-blocking failures and audit trail (WU-06)** -- Define warning and structured audit behavior for all wiki failures without altering core pipeline status. Acceptance: failure path logs warnings plus audit payloads.
7. **Propagate scaffold fields across stacks (WU-07)** -- Update nine stack `template-spec.yaml` files with consistent `wiki_update` defaults and contract reference. Acceptance: each stack spec includes identical wiki_update schema and values.
8. **Extend parity validator and tests (WU-08)** -- Update `templates/tools/validate-parity.ts` and `templates/tools/validate-parity.test.ts` for wiki contract and stack wiki field coverage. Acceptance: parity commands pass on compliant fixtures and fail with actionable messages on drift.
9. **Document operator workflow and governance (WU-09)** -- Update `README.md` and `templates/README.md` with trigger, scope, failure, output, approval, and governance procedures plus validation commands. Acceptance: docs pass command/path verification and support deterministic maintainer workflow.
10. **Record Stage 3 traceability** -- Append Stage 3 completion evidence in `agent-progress/` with links to this spec and implementation artifacts. Acceptance: stage gate evidence references every WU PBI.

## 8. Out of Scope
- Direct wiki publication API implementation to GitHub or GHES wiki endpoints.
- Historical backfill of prior completed tasks into wiki artifacts.
- Changes to non-wiki parity capabilities in `templates/shared/capability-parity-matrix.yaml` outside required linkage updates.
- Changes to template stack catalog composition in `templates/shared/stack-catalog.yaml`.
- Runtime feature additions outside Stage 7 post-task wiki flow.

## Stage 3 Gate Decision
Status: **PASS with clarifications pending**.

Rationale:
- All nine WU backlog items now have implementation-ready PBIs with functional AC, technical AC, test criteria, ordered steps, and out-of-scope boundaries.
- Defaults are locked to required values from the context package.
- Open questions are precise and non-ambiguous; implementation can start on contract, scaffold, and parity paths while finalizing artifact and idempotency details.

## Backlog Traceability
- Source backlog: `Design/wiki-update-backlog.md`
- Source architecture: `Design/wiki-update-architecture.md`
- This implementation-ready Stage 3 spec: `Design/wiki-update-pbi.md`
