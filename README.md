# ai-agent-workflows

> Installable pack of 32 custom AI agents, stack templates, and a skills library for Cursor and VS Code.

## Problem

Using AI coding assistants across many projects means redefining the same agents (orchestrator, implementer, reviewer, tester) and the same stack templates every time. That is repetitive, drifts between projects, and makes it hard to keep a consistent quality bar. This pack installs a curated, versioned set into any project with one command.

## Goal

A published npm package / CLI (`ai-agent-pack-install`) that installs a curated agent / skill / template set into any project, backed by a multi-IDE adapter system and a template parity validator that stops framework variants from drifting.

## Approach

Node 20 + TypeScript CLI built on `@inquirer/prompts` and `ajv`. Agents are plain `.agent.md` files with YAML frontmatter defining handoffs. Ten stack templates (Next.js, SvelteKit, Angular, backend Node, .NET, Python, Go, Java, Rust, web) share a parity validator. IDE targets are pluggable via an adapter registry (`cli/tools.registry.json` + `cli/lib/adapters.ts`), currently with VS Code and Cursor adapters.

## Implemented features

- 32 `*.agent.md` agent definitions covering orchestrator, implementers, reviewers, and specialists
- Embedded OpenSpec command workflow in the agent pipeline (`openspec propose` then `openspec apply`)
- 10 stack templates (frontend + backend variants) with shared contracts and CI workflow templates
- Deduplicated skills library organized by category
- `ai-agent-pack-install` CLI with an interactive wizard and non-interactive `--yes` mode
- Tool registry and adapter system (`adapters.ts`, `paths.ts`, `pipeline.ts`, `registry.ts`)
- Template parity validator (`templates/tools/validate-parity.ts`) with its own test suite
- Windows PowerShell + macOS shell installers with uninstall manifests
- Companion docs folders (Database, Deploy, Design, Testing, Strategy, etc.)

## What's left to reach the goal

- [ ] Publish the package to npm (currently installed only from a local path or `npm link`)
- [ ] Build the "optional" MSI / PKG installers the README mentions
- [ ] Add cross-IDE integration test evidence

## Getting started

### From npm (recommended)

The package is published as a **private** scoped module (`@nholder88/ai-agent-workflows-tools`). Installers need npm login and access to that scope (or a token with read access).

```bash
# Interactive install into VS Code / Cursor / Claude Code user paths
npx @nholder88/ai-agent-workflows-tools

# Or install globally
npm install -g @nholder88/ai-agent-workflows-tools
ai-agent-pack-install

# Non-interactive
npx @nholder88/ai-agent-workflows-tools --yes --targets vscode,cursor

# Help
ai-agent-pack-install --help
```

### From a clone (development)

```bash
npm install

# Interactive (same CLI as above)
npm run pack:install

# Non-interactive
npm run pack:install -- --yes --targets vscode,cursor

# Validate template parity after editing templates/**
npm run templates:test-parity
npm run templates:validate-parity
```

## Status

**Current:** working - 75% complete

Core installer, agents, templates, and tests are in place. Primary remaining work is first npm release and optional platform installers.
