**Task:** Refine wiki update backlog into implementation-ready PBI specs
**Status:** Complete
**Stage (if in pipeline):** Stage 3 — PBI Clarification

### Actions Taken
- Read architecture and backlog sources for WU-01 through WU-09.
- Reviewed parity tooling and test patterns in `templates/tools/validate-parity.ts` and `templates/tools/validate-parity.test.ts`.
- Created consolidated Stage 3 implementation-ready spec with per-PBI functional AC, technical AC, test criteria, implementation steps, and out-of-scope sections.
- Added backlog annotation linking Stage 2 backlog to Stage 3 implementation-ready spec.

### Files Created or Modified
- `Design/wiki-update-pbi.md` — Added implementation-ready Stage 3 PBI specification for WU-01..WU-09.
- `Design/wiki-update-backlog.md` — Added direct link to `Design/wiki-update-pbi.md` for traceability.
- `agent-progress/wiki-update-pbi-clarification.md` — Added pbi-clarifier completion log.

### Outcome
Produced a complete Stage 3 specification artifact at `Design/wiki-update-pbi.md` with gate coverage for each PBI and explicit defaults aligned to architecture and context package. Backlog now links to this Stage 3 spec for implementation handoff.

### Blockers / Open Questions
- Confirm approved reason-code vocabulary for classifier outcomes.
- Confirm PR-mode artifact path/schema consumed by orchestrator.
- Confirm idempotency key composition for Stage 7 retry handling.

### Suggested Next Step
Hand off to implementation agent to execute WU-01, WU-07, and WU-08 first, then complete orchestration and documentation tasks.
